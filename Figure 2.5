#The third coalescent simulation for a population of decreasing size (Figure 2.5). An decreasing population by setting N.0 equal to 50 and N.final equal to 20.
#A sample of 5 is then taken from the current generation by setting n equal to 5 and the simulation is ran over 30 generations again. The lines of 
#the sampled individuals are then highlighted in green using col.coal.
