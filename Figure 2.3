#The first coalescent simulation for a population of equal size (Figure 2.3). A population size of 20 is kept constant by setting both N.0 (the first generation) 
#and N.final (the current generation) equal to 20. A sample of 5 is then taken from the current generation by setting n equal to 5 and the simulation 
#is ran over 30 generations by setting TIME equal to 30. The lines of the sampled individuals are then highlighted in blue using col.coal.
